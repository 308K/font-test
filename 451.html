      "It was a pleasure to burn.",
      "We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over.",
      "There must be something in books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for nothing.",
      "If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none.",
      "It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in booksâ€¦ The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.",
